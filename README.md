# Customer-Analytics-in-Python
I use various Data Science and machine learning techniques to analyze customer data using STP framework. I perform correlation estimates, standardise the data, use segmentation, hierarchical clustering, k-means, PCA techniques with a lot of visualizations such as heatmaps, clusters, dendrograms, scatter plots to segment and understand customer data.

The file segmentation_data.csv is the dataset used in this project.

The file segmentation data legend.xlsx contains the legend of what each column means.
